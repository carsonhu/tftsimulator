# About the Project

This is a simulator for Teamfight Tactics. The intent of this project is to develop a way to mathematically determine the value that different items, buffs, augments, anomalies provide to different units in TFT, allowing the user to make more educated decisions during the game.

The sidebar allows you to configure the base settings, and the user can then plot the marginal DPS increase of adding an extra item / buff / augment / anomaly.
